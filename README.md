# Synopsys Security Scan

Synopsys Security Scan allows you to configure your azure pipeline to run Synopsys security testing and take action on the security results. Synopsys Security Scan leverages Synopsys Bridge, which allows you to run tests for several Synopsys products from the command line. The latest version of Synopsys Bridge is available [[here](https://sig-repo.synopsys.com/artifactory/bds-integrations-release/com/synopsys/integration/synopsys-bridge/)] 

# Quick Start for the Synopsys Security Scan

Synopsys Security Scan supports the following Synopsys security testing solutions:
- Polaris, a SaaS-based solution offering SAST, SCA and Managed Services in a single unified platform
- Coverity, using our thin client and cloud-based deployment model
- Black Duck Hub, supporting either on-premises or hosted instances

**Note:** Synopsys Security Sacn requires appropriate licenses for all Synopsys application used.

**To run Synopsys Security Scan:**

- Validate Scanning platform-related parameters like project and stream.
- Download the Synopsys Bridge and related adapters
- Run corresponding Synopsys security testing solutions (Polaris, Coverity, or Black Duck).
- Synopsys Security Scan code can be referenced from the latest release tag [[here](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/synopsys-extension)] 

Synopsys solution functionality is invoked directly by Synopsys Bridge, and indirectly by the Synopsys Security Scan, which downloads Synopsys Bridge and calls the respective adapters to run corresponding scans.

## Synopsys Security Scan - Polaris

Before running a pipeline using the Synopsys Security Scan and Polaris, add azure-pipelines.yml to your project.

Configure sensitive data like usernames, passwords and URLs using pipeline variables.

Push those changes and Agent will pickup the job and initiate the pipeline.

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
  
steps:
- task: synopsys-task@0.1.0
  inputs:
    bridge_polaris_serverUrl: $(POLARIS_SERVER_URL)
    bridge_polaris_accessToken: $(POLARIS_ACCESS_TOKEN)
    bridge_polaris_application_name: $(POLARIS_APPLICATION_NAME)
    bridge_polaris_project_name: $(POLARIS_PROJECT_NAME)
    ### Accepts Multiple Values
    bridge_polaris_assessment_types: "SCA,SAST"
```

# Synopsys Security Scan - Coverity Cloud Deployment with Thin Client

At this time, Synopsys Security Scan only supports the Coverity thin client/cloud deployment model, which removes the need for a large footprint installation in your Agent.

Before running Coverity using the Synopsys Security Scan, ensure the appropriate project and stream are set in your Coverity Connect server environment.

Configure sensitive data like usernames, passwords and URLs using pipeline variables.

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
  
steps:
- task: synopsys-task@0.1.0
  inputs:
    bridge_coverity_connect_url: $(COVERITY_URL)

    bridge_coverity_connect_project_name: $(COVERITY_PROJECT_NAME)
    bridge_coverity_connect_stream_name: $(COVERITY_STREAM_NAME)
```
| Input Parameter   | Description                           | Mandatory / Optional |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|

## Synopsys Security Scan - Black Duck

Synopsys Security Scan supports both self-hosted (e.g. on-prem) and Synopsys-hosted Black Duck Hub instances.

In the default Black Duck Hub permission model, projects and project versions are created on the fly as needed.

Configure sensitive data like usernames, passwords and URLs using pipeline variables.

```yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
  
steps:
- task: synopsys-task@0.1.0
  inputs:
    bridge_blackduck_url: $(BLACKDUCK_URL)
    bridge_blackduck_token: $(BLACKDUCK_TOKEN)
```

| Input Parameter | Description |  Mandatory / Optional |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
|`bridge_blackduck_url`  | URL for Black Duck server  | Mandatory     |
| `bridge_blackduck_token` | API token for Black Duck | Mandatory     |
| `bridge_blackduck_install_directory` | Directory path to install Black Duck  | Optional     |
| `bridge_blackduck_scan_full` | Specifies whether full scan is required or not. By default, pushes will initiate a full "intelligent" scan and pull requests will initiate a rapid scan. Supported values: true or false | Optional     |
| `bridge_blackduck_scan_failure_severities`      | The scan failure severities of Black Duck <br /> Example: <br />blackduck_scan_failure_severities: "ALL,NONE,BLOCKER,CRITICAL,MAJOR,MINOR,OK,TRIVIAL,UNSPECIFIED" | Optional |

- **Note about Detect command line parameters:** Any command line parameters that you need to pass to detect can be passed through variables. This is a standard capability of Detect. For example, if you want to only report newly found policy violations on rapid scans, you would normally use the command line --detect.blackduck.rapid.compare.mode=BOM_COMPARE_STRICT. You can replace this by setting the DETECT_BLACKDUCK_RAPID_COMPARE_MODE variable to BOM_COMPARE_STRICT.

## Additional Parameters

| Input Parameter | Description                              |  Mandatory / Optional | 
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|`synopsys_bridge_path`| Provide a path, where you want to configure or already configured Synopsys Bridge. [Note - If you don't provide any path, then by default configuration path will be considered as - $HOME/synopsys-bridge]. If the configured Synopsys Bridge is not the latest one, latest Synopsys Bridge version will be downloaded          | Optional     |
| `bridge_download_url`      | Provide URL to bridge zip file. If provided, Synopsys Bridge will be automatically downloaded and configured in the provided bridge- or default- path. [Note - As per current behavior, when this value is provided, the bridge_path or default path will be cleaned first then download and configured all the time]               | Optional     |
|`bridge_download_version`| Provide bridge version. If provided, the specified version of Synopsys Bridge will be downloaded and configured.              | Optional     |
| `include_diagnostics`      | All diagnostics files will be available to download when 'true' passed. Azure DevOps no longer supports per-pipeline retention rules. The only way to configure retention policies for YAML and classic pipelines is through the project settings. Refer the given documentation for more details: <br/> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/policies/retention?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#set-run-retention-policies               | Optional     |

Note - If **bridge_download_version** or **bridge_download_url** is not provided, Synopsys Security Scan will download and configure the latest version of Bridge
 

# Synopsys BridgeÂ Setup

- The latest version of Synopsys Bridge is available at: [Synopsys-Bridge](https://sig-repo.synopsys.com/artifactory/bds-integrations-release/com/synopsys/integration/synopsys-bridge/) 
- The most common way to set up the Synopsys Bridge is to configure the agent to download the small CLI utility that is then automatically run at the right stage of your pipeline.
- The latest version of Synopsys Bridge will be downloaded by default.

## Manual Synopsys Bridge

If you are unable to download the Synopsys Bridge from our internet-hosted repository or have been directed by support or services to use a custom version of the Synopsys Bridge, you can either specify a custom URL or pre-configure your Agent to include the Synopsys Bridge. In this latter case, you would specify the `synopsys_bridge_path` parameter to specify the location of the directory in which the Synopsys Bridge is pre-installed.

# Azure Agent Setup

- Agents can be installed and used on GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows and Docker. Refer the given documentation :
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser
- You can use Microsoft-hosted agents as well to scan your code using Azure Pipelines.
