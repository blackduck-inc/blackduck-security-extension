# `dist/index.js` is a special file in Actions.
# When you reference an action with `uses:` in a workflow,
# `index.js` is the code that will run.
# For our project, we generate this file through a build process from other source files.
# We need to make sure the checked-in `index.js` actually matches what we expect it to be.
# Workflow: Checks if the checked-in dist/index.js matches the expected build output. Ensures the dist/ directory is up-to-date and committed.
